# MultiClientServer
This repository presents an extension of the original vinyl record library application, transforming it into a multi-client system. Leveraging the established MVVM architecture, this enhanced version introduces server-side capabilities to support simultaneous connections from multiple users. Core architectural improvements include the implementation of the Strategy pattern for adaptable request handling, the Singleton pattern for centralized logging, and the Proxy pattern for controlled resource access. This evolution maintains the separation of concerns while incorporating key design principles like OCP to ensure scalability and maintainability in a multi-user environment.

Everything on Master branch!
